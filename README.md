| Approach | Description | Example Query | Result |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| **Traditional Gen AI** | Uses an LLM and knowledge base to provide direct responses. | ‚ÄúWhat are common types of personal loans?‚Äù | Lists secured and unsecured loans. |
| **Agentic AI** | Uses orchestrated agents for complex, data-driven reasoning. | ‚ÄúWhich personal loan options offer the best interest rates and repayment flexibility for individuals with a credit score below 650?‚Äù | Coordinates multiple agents (Product Research, Credit Risk, Compliance) to generate a synthesized, specific response (e.g., ‚ÄúCredit union loans with 8‚Äì12% APR‚Äù). |

---

## Key Concepts and Enabling Technologies

### Tools (Function Calling)
The ability of an AI system to **invoke external functions, APIs, or services** beyond its model parameters.  
Example: A model calls a **Flight API** to answer a question about an upcoming flight.

---

### Vector Store / Knowledgebases
A **specialized database** that stores and manages data as **vectors** to represent semantic meaning.  
This allows the AI to:
