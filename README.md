## AI-Q (Pronounced “IQ”) NVIDIA Blueprint

The **AI-Q Blueprint** is an **open-source framework** that integrates **Nemotron reasoning models** with **AI agents, data, and tools** for tasks such as research and reporting.  

### Core Capabilities:
- Upload and connect **custom data sources**.  
- **Synthesize hours of material in minutes**.  
- Designed for **multi-modal, large-scale data processing**.

### Main Components:
| Component | Function |
|------------|-----------|
| **Llama Nemotron** | Boosts AI agents with reasoning skills – "#1 Open Reasoning Models" |
| **NeMo Retriever** | Connects AI agents to data for fast, accurate, multi-modal retrieval |
| **NeMo Agent Toolkit** | Connects, evaluates, and optimizes agentic systems while identifying bottlenecks |
